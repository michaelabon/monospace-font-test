Instructions
============

Open the other file with your favourite text editor.

Make sure you are using a monospace font.

What to look for
================

- Can you distinguish between O and 0? Between 1, l, I, and L?
- Do you like the look of the math? How about the regex?
- Do matching sets of punctuation line up/

Purpose
=======
